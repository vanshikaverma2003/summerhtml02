    You are my fire
    The one desire
    Believe when I say
    I want it that way
    But we are two worlds apart Can't reach to your heart
        When you say
        That I want it that way [Chorus: Nick & All]
            Tell me why
            Ain't nothin' but a heartache
            Tell me why
            Ain't nothing but a mistake. Tell me why
            I never wanna hear you say
            I want it that way <span class="p-reference">Am I your fire?
                Your one desire
                Yes, I know it's too late
                But I want it that way</span>. [Chorus: AJ, All & Brian]
                Tell me why
                Ain't nothin' but a heartache
                Tell me why
                 <span class="p-reference">Ain't nothin' but a mistake
                    Tell me why
                    I never wanna hear you say
                    I want it that way</span>.

<p>
    Now I can see that we're fallin' apart
    From the way that it used to be, yeah
    No matter the distance, I want you to know
    That deep down inside of me <span class="p-reference">You are my fire
        The one desire
        You are
        (You are, you are, you are)</span>.
</p>

<p>
    
    Don't wanna hear you say, yeah, yeah
    Ain't nothin' but a heartache
    Ain't nothin' but a mistake (Don't wanna hear you say)
    I never wanna hear you say (Oh, yeah)<span class="p-reference">I want it that way</span> 
</p>
<p>
    I want it that way
<span class="p-reference">Tell me why
    Ain't nothing but a heartache</span>
    Tell me why
        Ain't nothing but a mistake
        Tell me why
        I never wanna hear you say
        I want it that way
        </p>

        <p>
              Tell me why...
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
            <span class="p-reference">I never wanna hear you say</span>I want it that way
            Cos' I want it that way</p>
